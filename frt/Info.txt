Hashes gathered from game files using FoxLibDumper: https://github.com/TinManTex/FoxLibDumper

Hashes in file format:
RouteNames - StrCode32
RouteEventNames - StrCode32
RouteEventParameters - StrCode32

Further notes for hash wrangling:
RouteEventParameters - Odd duck, Collection of 10 parameters per node, some of which may or may not be hashes depending on the type of RouteEvent. 
Currently all the parameters were dumped as if they were hashes.

Currently TPP only.
