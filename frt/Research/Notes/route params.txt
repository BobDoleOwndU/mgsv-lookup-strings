GOTCHA: Params listed here start from 1 - Route builder now labels params from 0

Param1: aimTargetType - aimTargetType sets up RouteAimTargetType / TppAimTargetDesc? (see gz exe route classes.txt)
(in hex) 
+0 for edge event classes (Walk,Run etc) (ie 0 100 200)
+1 for node event classes (Idle etc) 	 (ie 1 101 201)
0 	- ROUTE_AIM_NO_TARGET
100 - ROUTE_AIM_STATIC_POINT
200 - ROUTE_AIM_CHARACTER
300 - ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_SIGHT_MOVE_PATH
400 - ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_OBJECT

Only on event node (I mean event node classes, in practice some route use event nodes as edges for some reason) VERIFY 
- some variant of above, or using as some extra bool flag, possibly ConstantVelocityMove?
1000000 - ROUTE_AIM_NO_TARGET
1000100 - ROUTE_AIM_STATIC_POINT
1000200 - ROUTE_AIM_CHARACTER
1000300 - ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_SIGHT_MOVE_PATH
1000400 - ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_OBJECT

Unsure of the difference between ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_SIGHT_MOVE_PATH and ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_OBJECT
Can't currently test due to more routeset creation issue

Param2: ? almost always has a value - seems to be time related, trying different values from game routes changes , value as float is nonsensical

Param3: Depends on Param1/aimTargetType
ROUTE_AIM_NO_TARGET - ? - always 0
ROUTE_AIM_STATIC_POINT - X: float
ROUTE_AIM_CHARACTER - aimCharacterNameS32 - ex S32"Player" or S32"sol_vip_village"
ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_SIGHT_MOVE_PATH - aimRouteS32 - S32"some_aim_route_name" (aim route names haven't been found since they are soley referenced within routes) (or S32 empty string, never 0)
ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_OBJECT - aimRoute - as above

Param4: Depends on Param1/aimTargetType
ROUTE_AIM_NO_TARGET - always 0
ROUTE_AIM_STATIC_POINT - Y: float
ROUTE_AIM_CHARACTER - ? - never 0, - bodySection/bone to aim at?
ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_SIGHT_MOVE_PATH - ? - never 0 - S32 empty string or sometimes == to Param3
ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_OBJECT - ?

Param5: Depends on Param1/aimTargetType
ROUTE_AIM_NO_TARGET - always 0
ROUTE_AIM_STATIC_POINT - Z: float
ROUTE_AIM_CHARACTER - always 0
ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_SIGHT_MOVE_PATH - ? - never 0 - S32 empty string or sometimes == to Param4
ROUTE_AIM_ROUTE_AS_OBJECT - ?

ex for ROUTE_AIM_STATIC_POINT as x,y,z float
RelaxedWalk 
Param1: 100, - ROUTE_AIM_STATIC_POINT
Param2: 0, 
Param3: 4447f940, =  799.894531	X? 
Param4: 43e8bd1a, =  465.477356 Y?
Param5: c48748d3, =  -1082.27576 Z?
Param6: 0, 
Param7: 0, 
Param8: 0, 
Param9: 0, 
Param10: 0, 

On initial testing with ROUTE_AIM_STATIC_POINT, and setting param3,4,5 to x,y,z float>uint seems correct, soldier looks at point.

Param6: 0 or S32"" or (for s10121, rts_pfCamp_c_0011, RelexedStandIdle only) route - there param3>param6 are the same route,
so posibly just copy paste/user error, though that would mean param6 only has two unique values, both of which are essentially 0/nothing

Param7:

Param8:

Param9:

Param 10 - specific to event type? - 0 exept for:

728879063 (unknown eventname)
Param10: 0 2 3

ConversationIdle
Param10: 0 28 2d 32 - (dec) 40 45 50

Normal

TODO:
I would have expected some kind of wait/execution time on nodes in general, or at least the idles?
There's "time" seen in frt snippet reconstruction but don't know if that's a specifc or not
param2 ?

---
Some specific event types:

ConversationIdle - TppRouteNodeEventConversation ?
rts_tent_Executioner_loop_0000
P7: conversationListName (S32) - ex "speech52_EV060", 
P8: partnerCharacterId (S32) - ex "hos_target_0000", 
P9: 9059, 
P10: 32,  

SwitchRoute - conditional route change
P7: routeIdS32 ex "rt_slopedTown_c_0001", 
P8: conditionNameS32 ex "CanNotUseSearchLight", 
P9: conditionGameId/gimmickId - ex "afgh_wtct001_gim_n0000|srt_afgh_wtct001"

conditionNames
"IsNotGimmickBroken" 
"IsGimmickBroken" 
"CanUseSearchLight" 
"CanNotUseSearchLight" 



SendMessage - fires a lua RoutePoint2 message which passes in P8,P9
P1: 1, 
P2: c48401df, 
P3: 0, 
P4: 0, 
P5: 0, 
P6: 0, 
P7: 6f02,  ?

P9: message2S32 - ex "10", 
P10: 0,

3657493f - 911690047 - ? doesnt seem to work?
7812dd98 - 2014502296 - smoke
87b99d7a - 2277088634 - SoldierFootStep - takes a few steps around and returns to spot
f528c82c - 4113090604 - ? doesnt seem to work?

HeliIdle
Enter enemy attack heli (when on soldier route)
P2 - time - Only param ever set, stays in heli reguardless 
Hard coded to either "enemyheli" heli or simply first heli game object
Will warp to start of getting in heli animation
Is either on soldier routes or heli routes
untested on heli routes, cant think how it would work

Normal - and posibly other heli movement?
