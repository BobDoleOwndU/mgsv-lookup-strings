SubTool
subp_dictionary.txt - Default dictionary
StrCode32 of subtitleId
Currently just Tpp dictionary.

subp_dictionary_HashStringMatches.txt - useful for figuring out what the discovered string was when you have only the hash (you have a file from older dictionary).

SubTool outputs .subp.xml
Id key is subtitleId StrCode32 hash. Naming is legacy from when tool was created. Leaving as-is to not break any existing worked on .subp.xml (I think there's some translation projects out there).

Output dictionary of current set of strings in subp_dictionary-test has been manually edited to remove a few incorrect matches, others seem right but haven't been exhaustively checked.
