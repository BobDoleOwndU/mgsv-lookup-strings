A collection of validated dictionaries for recovering strings for hashed values in files from Fox Engine games.
https://metalgearmodding.fandom.com/wiki/File_Formats_Used_in_MGSV_(List)

Also includes hashes from those files and collections of strings for testing hashes.

Dictionaries - In <tool name> folders for older tools, see the Info.txt for info specific to that dictionary.

Hashes - Currently spread throughout <tool name> and <file type> folders.
New organsisations is <file type>\<string/data type>\<game>

Strings - Various lookup strings mostly unfiltered string scrapes from exe,fox2 etc. Used to test various hashes.

<dictionary name>_HashStringMatches.txt - can useful for figuring out what the discovered string was when you only have the hash (you have a file/note from older dictionary).

If you wish to contribute to the dictionaries please run additions through Hashwrangler to validate them and keep a consistent sort.
