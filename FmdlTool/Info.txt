FmdlTool / Fmdl Studio
fmdl_dictionary.txt - Default dictionary
Tpp format fmdls have two hash tables
nameHashes - StrCode64
textureHashes - PathCode64

Hashes output from FmdlTool fork https://github.com/TinManTex/FmdlTool using -OutputHashes option

Default fmdl_dictionary is combined Tpp/Mgo
qar_dictionary can be used for texture dictionary, though I have gathered hashes and compiled dictionaries for analysis sake named texture_dictionary

fmdl_dictionary_HashStringMatches.txt - useful for figuring out what the discovered string was when you have only the hash (you have a file from older dictionary).

FmdlTool\Hashes\StrCode64\Tpp\
\All folder The full nameHash table dumps of fmdls.
All_unique.txt - the combined/sorted/unqified of All
bone,materials,meshGroup,texureType,unknown - individual output of specific hashes, though currently they dont tally with all.

FmdlTool\Dictionaries\ 
bone,materials,meshGroup,texureType,unknown - matches of different sub types, not currently up to date but useful to get an idea of what the strings are.

Finding strings:
Name hashes:
Theres a lot of object names that can either be derived from parts of paths/file name or parts of fox2 names.
Should also try object names with MESH_ prefix and SKL_<nnn> prefix (SKL bones are better to run through dictionary attack though with object names as words)
